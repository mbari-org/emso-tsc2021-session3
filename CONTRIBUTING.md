## Git Configuration

To avoid checking in notebooks with cell outputs:

###  Add notebook filtering
 
To filter output from any added notebooks, issue this command. Note that this only needed once after the repository is cloned.

```shell
git config --local include.path .gitconfig
```

### Cleaning

To clean the artifacts generated by the notebooks, first, try a dry-run with:

```shell
git clean -fn
```

then to finally clean

```shell
git clean
```
